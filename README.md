# Beats: ConUHacks VII
## Overview
Feel the beat of emotions with Beats!  

Beats is a hackathon-winning real-time messaging application that can quantitatively analyze the emotions of the message senders. This is the Swift codebase for our ios app and Apple Watch integration.
## Getting started
Running and modifying this project requires macOS.
1. Open Flash Chat iOS13.xcodeproj with Xcode. 
2. Build. Voil√†!
## Inspiration
The inspiration for the project Beats came from the desire to create a more authentic and accurate way for people to communicate their emotions online. Traditional text-based messaging can be misinterpreted, leading to misunderstandings and conflicts. With the increasing use of data analysis and quantification in various industries, it seemed like a natural next step to apply this to the realm of emotions.  
## What's next for Beats
We want to integrate Beats into popular applications like iMessage, Instagram and Tinder. In addition, the app's ability to track and analyze emotions can be used as an emotional coach. It can help users to understand their emotions and other people's emotions better and provide suggestions for coping strategies and mental health resources.
